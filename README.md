# Dot Files

I thought it might be a good idea to versionize my dot files (e.g. `.bashrc`) in case I lose them or just mess up.

So thats that...

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/NobodysNightmare/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && ~/dotfiles/setup.sh
```

Note: If any of those dotfiles already exist, they will be overwritten...
Be sure that you like my files :)
